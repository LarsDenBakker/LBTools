<p>The LBTools project started out of frustration with the existing tools available to create plugins for the Minecraft servers I was running at the time. I did not want to keep on doing the same thing over and over, I wanted to give my admins access to advance administration features without having to hardcore everything and, as a server owner, I wanted a system that was much more user oriented than other systems were at the time. </p>

<p>I was not able to find an appropriate framework to offer this at the time. The decision was made to create my own library. I have since stopped doing most of my work on Minecraft servers, but the project still remains valid. I have learned much more since the inception of this project, and also learned that there are great frameworks out there that I do not mean to replace. More than anything right now this project is a study subject, a way to challenge myself into becoming better and better. In the future I will learn how well this framework will stand up to other frameworks.</p>

<p><strong>Modular</strong>
Modules are loaded on the fly, keeping the library lightweight loading only what is necessary.
<strong>Consistent</strong>
Concepts that share common features are abstracted, the same style is kept and used throughout the code. The user has to understand only a few concepts to be able to apply it to every module.
<strong>User-oriented</strong>
A huge priority in writing this library is that the user understands what's going on when something goes wrong.
<strong>Administrator friendly</strong>
An often neglected group are administrators. These are people who really work with the core of your program, but don't have a lot of coding knowledge and/or don't have the ability/time to hack into the source code of the program. In LBTools they have extensive access to advance administration features and where possible LBTools will report back exactly how to fix an issue. </p>
